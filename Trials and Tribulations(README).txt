1. I struggled deciding on what I wanted to make for my final Project so
   I decided to pay homage to the younger me that wanted to make Video
   Games

2. I had a hard time putting Images in the background with Texts, Labels,
   and entry boxes on top until I realized I could use .place and .pack

3. I spent way too much time trying to find a way to hold User input and
   have it be displayed somewhere without scrapping a lot of what I had
   until I realized I could move my stringvar variables into the proper Function
    (optiongame) and that it could then be kept and pushed to the console to
    display.

4. I struggle a lot with Python and all the terms and knowing what I can and can't
   do in a scenario so while I had it all planned out in my head, coding it
   was a major headache and it came out much simplier than I had envisioned.
   (I actually wanted to use Pygame for the project)

5. I had to reinstall things like Pil and pillow, and turtle (I had another project
   planned before this one and decided to merge the two).

6. Many times I asked myself: "Why am I doing this? How will this get me into those
   3 letter Agencies? Why haven't I slept?" People make coding look so easy.

6 (cont.) In the end, coding is like a puzzle. You fix one part and ruin another, until all
   your pieces fit without coming undone. And when you finally acheive what you
   are trying to do, the bigger picture it makes is beautifully artistic in its
   own way.

   P.s. I wish we stuck to: print("Hello World"). I was less tired then.
